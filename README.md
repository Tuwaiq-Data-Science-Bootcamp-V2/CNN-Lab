Idea: 
Build a deep learning model that can recognize the human handwritten digits.
Note:
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits.

Dataset:
MNIST is the “hello world” of image classification datasets. 
It contains tens of thousands of handwritten digits ranging from zero to nine. 
Each image is of size 28×28 pixels.
